# Next we can do some miscellaneous type casting before we tackle what I think

# that need to occur:
# population_sample_size -> integer;
# vaccine -> filter out only seasonal;
# geography_type -> factor;
# geography can stay as character for now. there are 1922 unique levels but
#  they are nested in geography_type, so can be type casted where needed;
# fips can stay as character. Most are sparse and this info should be encoded
#  in the other geography variables, so no need to use RAM on a big factor;
# year/season and month -> combine into date variable.
# dimension_type / dimension: these are the annoying ones that I will do in
#  a separate step.
# Let's do the simple conversions (everything except date and dimension) first.

# Next step is to combine the dates together. There are multiple ways to deal
#  with this, but for now I'll take the simplistic approach of marking each
#  date as the first day of the month.
# Then afterwards, I can convert the flu season to a factor, as well as month
#  and the constructed year to numeric.
# For this conversion, I will assume that month 8 - 12 are in the first year of
#  the season, and month 1 - 5 are in the second year of the season. This is
#  the norm for flu data, but it is not technically in the documentation, so it
#  is an assumption.
